POSL 0.9

POSL is a small framework to support the implementation of a custom domain specific language
Using POSL a developer can add or remove features to provide scripting support, or a terminal interface

The engine provides structural support to the language:

a basic line consists of a keyword, representing a command, followed by a number of arguments.
a priority of execution is defined by square brackets [ ].
a series of arguments can be encompassed in curly braces { }.
